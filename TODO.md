# Glacis United Stats — TODO

## UI & Data Improvements

- [ ] **Lost Possession Heatmap** — Display the types of lost possession events (bad touch, failed pass, failed dribble)
- [ ] **Match Card Win/Loss Label** — Show "Win" or "Loss" based on the Glacis United club name rather than generic home/away
- [ ] **Match Stats Page** — Re-evaluate the data shown on the match stats page
- [ ] **Match Stats Tabs** — Fix confusion around match stats layout and tab organisation
- [ ] **Data Visualization Review** — Audit all visualizations for clarity; some data is confusing at times

## Features

- [ ] **PWA & Push Notifications** — Make the app installable as a PWA with offline caching and push notifications for completed matches
